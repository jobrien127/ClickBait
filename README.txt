# ClickBait
JavaScript game for CSCI 445.

Creating the game was a very enlightening expierence, and was useful to gain knowledge of frontend development. Text shadow is one of the features of CSS3 that we are using. This feature is great to make a text distinct and really standout. Border radius is also a property in CSS3 which was used to make the page style more appealing. Finaly we were able to have an animation for sliding up on the end of game summary. We had the opportunity to use JQuery on the project and it was a little more useful at points than javascript could have been.

Cool features that we were able to implement were changing the colors of circles when clicked. This makes it very easy for the player to see which button has been clicked by displaying a color different from the initial red and green. We were also able to ensure that the circles do not overlap by comparing a new circle to past circles and using the distance formula to see that they were two radii away.
